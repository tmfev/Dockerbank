# gPAS #
The gPAS (generic Pseudonym Administration Service) generates and administers appropriate pseudonyms using non-deterministic pseudonyms for arbitrary alphanumeric sequences. Additionally it allows defining domain-specific alphabets and generator algorithms as required and offers functions for de-pseudonymisation and anonymisation.
